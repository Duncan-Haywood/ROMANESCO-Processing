/**
A few method to code in RPE – Romanesco Processing Environment –
*/

// PVECTOR
///////////
PVector gotoTarget(PVector origin,  PVector finish, float speed) // nice for a static travel when the start and the arrival is knew, work with XYZ

PVector follow(PVector target, float speed) // go to follow something in move like a cursor, works with XYZ


PVector [] circle (PVector pos, int d, int num) // return a list of points xyz to realize a circle, the first param is the position of circle, the second is the diameter, the third is the num of points to do this circle
PVector [] circle (PVector pos, int d, int num, float jitter) // same function with jitter variation

PVector pointOnCirlcle(int r, float angle) // return the position of the point on the perimeter of the circle. The first param is the radius, the second is the angle in radian (PI scale)






// TIME
///////
float cycle(float add) // return value between -1 et 1 , nice to try with value like 0.1

int timer(float tempo) // return an add value from float <1 ;

int minClock() // return the time of the day in minutes







// LOCAL methods or variables for SCENE and PRESCENE
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// WHERE are Romanesco work
if you want use a different rendering on the scene or prescene, you can use those booleans.

boolean fullRendering 
> to choice tha quality of rendering, for the Prescene is false, for the Scene is true

boolean internet 
> @ return boolean if internet is available

boolean scene 
boolean prescene
> this way is deprecated









LEAP MOTION or MOUSE ORDER
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––
boolean ORDER_ONE ; return "true" the leftClick or when only one finger are in the leapmotion field	
boolean ORDER_TWO ; return "true" the rightClick or when only two fingers are in the leapmotion field	
boolean ORDER_THREE ; return "true" when three fingers are in the leapmotion field
