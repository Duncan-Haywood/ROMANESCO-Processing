## WARNING
the most information below is from the previous version devellopement, there is a lot of improvement and change, so the information content can be wrong ; for the moment contact me is a better solution :)

Those sketches are the progress in work, writen for Processing 3.4

To download the last built version, go to [app 2.0.0.31](http://romanescoproject.wordpress.com/download/)

## Architecture Sketches
- Romanesco : Sketch to set the Romanesco application.
- Controleur : interface slider to use the objects and the different parameters.
- Prescene : use it to move the object in 3D.
- Scene : display the result. We can use this one to send to syphon or not.
- Romanesco must be coded with Processing 3.4

## Memory
Romanesco Prescene and Scene need a lot of memory to run in processing. You will maybe need to increase the Processing memory.

## Help to code
If you want to code in Romanesco, there are a few compulsory variables, methods and functions. You can find the different helpful files in the "[Misc](./MISC)" folder.
