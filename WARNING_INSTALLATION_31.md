To open Romanesco and because it's a free and open-source software you cannot open like you want.
Welcome in new world of Apple.
But we are cyberpunks, so FUCK OFF APPLE and the his capitalistic system who protect you against the uggly black hats!!!
Happyness it's for our own security !!!!


*SIERRA and after

You cannot be free for your safety. Now the option "anywhere" is deeply hide... so let's go to hack your OS system.

Unzip your file

Copy and past app one by one in a new place, but be careful. Respect the architectory of the software.
Romanesco_31, Controleur_30, Prescene_30_fullscreen...
for the folder you can copy and paste all in the same time

To switch off the OSsierra Gatekeeper security !
Open the terminal, and write this line:
sudo spctl --master-disable 

Launch Romanesco, after you can enable the security.
sudo spctl --master-enable

Sometime Romanesco scene freeze when it's the first opening on a new OS session, but the second opening is cool.
It's a bug from beyond !!!!!

It's just incredible to do that, it's like when you by an house, you must ask
the authorization to the previous owner to put something you love in your house...
